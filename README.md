## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aashish1799/Online-Fraud-Detection.git
cd Online-Fraud-Detection
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- **Windows**:
  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Train the Model

```bash
python fraud_model_trainer.py
```

This script handles data download, preprocessing, model training, and saves the final pipeline to `fraud_detection_pipeline.pkl`.

### 5. Launch the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```
